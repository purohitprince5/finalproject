      <h2>About Book Library Project</h2>

      <p>
        This Book Library project is a simple React application developed to
        manage a collection of books. It allows users to add new books with
        title, category, and description.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project is built using React components, props, and useState for
        state management. It demonstrates core React concepts such as reusable
        components, event handling, and conditional rendering.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users can view all added books in a list format and remove books when
        they are no longer needed. This project follows a clean and simple UI
        design to ensure easy understanding and usability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, this project helps in understanding the basics of React and how
        to build a small real-world application using component-based
        architecture.
